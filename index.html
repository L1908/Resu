    <h2>Summary</h2>
        <h4>I've worked for 7 years in the media industry covering roles such as animator, 
        illuatrator, writer, producer and I didn't love it anymore. I developed a need to create
        beneath the surface, the adobe suite was great but I wanted to see the code, how this application
        came into being. This birthed a passion for web development, I can create in below and aove the surface I can build applications that enrich
        lives. Corny, but yeah I do get excited because I finally understand what am I'm looking when inspecting a webpage on Google.</h4>
